Lab 3 exercises   lab time: 120 minutes

Lab 3 has two objectives:![](Aspose.Words.5d164e3f-2b7a-4ab2-a575-05dbcdb905e1.003.png)

- Primary: Implement the DeskBankApp [refer to Lab 2 class-diagram]
- Secondary: Complete the practice exercises [ 1 to 7] Complete the Lab 3 exercises using either Java or Python. Recommended IDE for Java and Python:  vscode

Lab 3

**Case Study:** Develop the DeskBankAppsystem – First Implementation

This exercise is the first implementation of the DeskBankAppcase study [refer to Lab1 and Lab2]

1- Create the system classes. Ensure that the main class is called: Bank Sample I/O![](Aspose.Words.5d164e3f-2b7a-4ab2-a575-05dbcdb905e1.004.png)

2- Define each class attributes based on the class-diagram in Lab 2 Amount to deposit $ 200.2 ![](Aspose.Words.5d164e3f-2b7a-4ab2-a575-05dbcdb905e1.005.png)3-Define each class operations based on the class-diagram in Lab2 Amount $200.20 deposited 4- Define main() method in Bank that offers customers the following actionsAmount to withdraw $ 50.5

- make a deposit (read amount from STDIN) and display (amount deposited)Amount $50.50 withdrawn
- make a withdraw (read amount from STDIN) and display (amount withdrawn)

Lab 3 Exercises

**Exercise 1:** Write a program to initialize two variables x to 4 and y to 2. Then print out the results of the following operations (each result on a line and format floating point at 3-decimal formats). 

x + y![](Aspose.Words.5d164e3f-2b7a-4ab2-a575-05dbcdb905e1.006.png)

x -y   

x / y

x \* y

x % y + x / y

(y7 + 7/(√5 +x)) \* (x4 % 5  + 2)

**Exercise 2:** Write code that completes the following operations:

1. Read in the integer values of x and y from STDIN![](Aspose.Words.5d164e3f-2b7a-4ab2-a575-05dbcdb905e1.007.png)
1. declare a variable z assign the result of x power y to it 
1. declare a variable called ‘result’ and assign the square-root of z to it
1. print out each of the above results on a new line (formatted at 2 decimal points) 

**Exercise 3:** Write code that output the following and determine the input type, area and volume:

1. Enter circle radius:  xyz![ref1]
1. Circle area of radius “value of radius go here” is:area
1. Sphere volume of radius “value of radius go here” is:volume 

**NOTE:** The value of the radius must be printed between double quotes **NOTE:** all values should be formatted at 2 –decimal points 

**Exercise 4:** Write code that runs as follows and calculates the distance between A and B:

1. Please enter the x1 coordinate of point A: 1.0![ref1]
1. Please enter the y1 coordinate of point A: 2.0
1. Please enter the x2 coordinate of point B: 3.0
1. Please enter the y2 coordinate of point B: 4.0
1. The distance between A(x1,y1) and B(x2,y2) is distance

**NOTE:** The values x1, y1, x2, y2 must be formatted into the output **NOTE:** format the distance at 3-decimal points

**Exercise 5:** Write code that runs as follows:

1. Please enter a string: *type your input here![ref1]*
1. First character: *display first character of the string*
1. Last character: *display last character of the string*
1. Lower-case string: *convert and display the string in lower-case*
1. String length: *display the length of the string*

**Exercise 6:** Develop a class called Car as follows

1- The class should have two fields: make and pos![ref2]

2- Define a constructor that initializes the fields

3- Define a function to move the position by distance

4- Define the object descriptive function that returns: <make> is at position <posvalue> 5- Create an object car of Type Car and initialize it to “BMW” and 0 6- Print current position

7- Move the car by 15

8- Print the new position

**Exercise 7:** Develop a class called Numbers as follows

1- Create an array of integers called ‘numbers’ of size n ![ref2]2-read n from STDIN

3- Display the array

4- Modify the first element to 10

5- Modify the last element to -5

6- Modify the middle element to 3

7- Display the array again
